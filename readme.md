# Code Explanation

## Backend (Node.js & Express)
Express: The backbone of our server, handling routing and HTTP requests.
Mongoose: Used for schema-based interaction with MongoDB.
## Routes
books.js: Manages CRUD operations for books.
transactions.js: Manages book borrowing and returning operations.
## Database Models
Book Model: Defines the structure for books, including title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
## Transaction Model: Tracks book borrowing and returning transactions, including dates.
Frontend (HTML, CSS & Bootstrap)
## Bootstrap: 
Ensures a responsive layout with minimal custom CSS.
## JavaScript:
Handles dynamic content updates, form submissions, and interaction with the backend via the fetch API.
Real-time updates on available copies and borrowed books using event listeners and the fetch API.
Theme toggling with state saved in local storage.
## Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing book and transaction data.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB, simplifying database operations.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive design.
JavaScript: For dynamic frontend interactions.
## Frontend Design
The frontend is designed with a simple and clean interface using Bootstrap. It allows users to interact with the backend through a responsive UI that includes forms for adding and editing books, buttons for borrowing and returning books, and real-time updates on the availability of books.
