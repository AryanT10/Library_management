Library Management System
Overview
This project is a simple Library Management System built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. The system allows users to manage a collection of books and perform basic operations such as borrowing and returning books. It features a RESTful API backend and a Bootstrap-powered frontend.

Project Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine
MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB installation)
Git for version control
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
Install dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:


npm install
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:


MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster0.mongodb.net/library_management?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Populate the database with initial data:

Run the populateBooks.js script to populate the database with sample books:


node routes/populateBooks.js
Start the server:

Run the server with the following command:


npm start
The server will be running at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
Books API
GET /api/books: Retrieve all books in the library.
POST /api/books: Add a new book to the library. Expects a JSON body with title, author, and ISBN.
GET /api/books/
: Retrieve a single book by its ID.
PUT /api/books/
: Update a book's details by its ID. Expects a JSON body with title, author, and ISBN.
DELETE /api/books/
: Delete a book by its ID.
Transactions API
POST /api/transactions/borrow: Borrow a book. Expects a JSON body with title and ISBN.
POST /api/transactions/return: Return a borrowed book. Expects a JSON body with title and ISBN.
GET /api/transactions/borrowed: Retrieve a list of all currently borrowed books.
Frontend Design
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It provides a clean and responsive user interface for managing books and transactions. Key features include:

Books List: Displays a list of all books in the library, along with options to edit or delete them. Each book card shows the title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
Add/Edit Book Form: Allows users to add a new book or edit an existing one. The form is dynamically shown and hidden as needed.
Borrow/Return Section: Users can borrow or return books by providing the book's title and ISBN. The system automatically updates the available copies.
Borrowed Books List: Displays a list of currently borrowed books with details about the borrow date and title.
Explanation of Code
Backend (Node.js & Express)
Express: The backend framework used for handling HTTP requests and routing.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB. Used to define schemas and interact with the MongoDB database.
Routes:
books.js: Contains routes for managing books (CRUD operations).
transactions.js: Handles borrowing and returning of books.
Middleware: Body-parser is used to parse JSON request bodies. Error handling middleware ensures graceful error responses.
Database Models:
Book Model: Defines the schema for books, including title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
Transaction Model: Tracks book borrow and return transactions, including the borrow date and return date.
Frontend (HTML, CSS & Bootstrap)
Bootstrap: Used for styling and layout, providing a responsive and modern UI.
JavaScript:
app.js: Handles all frontend logic, including fetching data from the API, updating the DOM, and managing the borrow/return forms.
Dynamic content insertion and form handling are done through event listeners and fetch API calls.
Theme toggling is handled using local storage to save the user's preference for light or dark mode.
Why These Technologies?
Node.js & Express: Chosen for their simplicity and efficiency in creating RESTful APIs. Express's middleware capabilities also make it easy to extend functionality.
MongoDB & Mongoose: NoSQL database that's well-suited for managing a collection of documents like books. Mongoose simplifies database interactions with schema-based data modeling.
Bootstrap: Provides a responsive and visually appealing design with minimal effort, ensuring the frontend looks good on all devices.
JavaScript: Used to handle dynamic interactions on the frontend, such as form submissions and real-time updates.
Conclusion
This Library Management System is a simple yet powerful example of a full-stack web application. It covers essential CRUD operations, real-time data updates, and a clean user interface, providing a solid foundation for further development and learning.
